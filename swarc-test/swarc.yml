Development view  

    Naming conventions
        Naming conventions for software entities
        traces naming conventions
        Reference to CMP if needed
    Development process references  (SWE1-6)
    Programming languages & required tools
        Coding style/guide
        Static code check tools
        Dynamic code check tools
        Debug/Trace tools
    3rd party libraries/tools. For each:
        Feasibility study
        License analysis
        Usage limitations (which part and where)
        Applicable processes (i/e should be static check it?)
    Integration strategy or reference
    Testing strategy reference

Dynamic view  

    Startup/shutdown
    Error handling
    Most important cross domain sequence diagrams
        must cover all cross domain communication
        must show cross domain calls or dataflow
        recommended not to show details of dynamic behavior inside domain

Deployment view 

    System topology (must be linked to System Architecture)
        HW alignment
        System interfaces
    Software topology (which component align to..)
        CPU/Core alignment
        Processes/threads/tasks alignment
        Inter process communication methods (IPC)
    Data topology (for each: where stored, how managed)
        Persistent data
        Configurations
        Variants
        Variant management
    Resources allocation restrictions
        CPU
        GPU
        RAM
        Storage
